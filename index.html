      <h2>What is the Water Cycle?</h2>
      <p>The water cycle is a continuous process that involves the movement of water between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. It consists of four main stages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Evaporation</li>
        <li>Condensation</li>
        <li>Precipitation</li>
        <li>Collection</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What are the types of the Water Cycle?</h2>
      <p>The water cycle comprises several processes, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Evaporation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Condensation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Precipitation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Collection</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What do they all mean?</h2>
      <p><strong>Evaporation:</strong> This is when the sun's heat causes water to change from a liquid state to a gaseous state (water vapor), allowing it to rise into the atmosphere. It occurs primarily from the Earth's surface, including oceans, lakes, rivers, and even plants through a process called transpiration.</p>
      <p><strong>Condensation:</strong> As the water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools and condenses back into liquid water, forming clouds. This process is crucial for the formation of clouds, which are essential for weather patterns and precipitation.</p>
      <p><strong>Precipitation:</strong> This refers to the release of condensed water vapor from clouds in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Precipitation is a vital part of the water cycle as it replenishes water sources on Earth, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater.</p>
      <p><strong>Collection:</strong> Once precipitation falls to the Earth's surface, it collects in various water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, or it may infiltrate into the soil to become groundwater. This collected water then undergoes further processes such as evaporation, transpiration, and runoff, continuing the water cycle.</p>
